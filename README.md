## About

media-viewer is a cross platform application to browse media collections.
The app design is based on Google Picasa, which is no longer available, so I needed a replacement, for browsing and sorting my pictures.

NOTE: Video support is not implemented yet, but planned.

## Features

- add multiple source folders
- Grid view to browse all supported formats
- Thumbnail generation for fast browsing
- Resize the display size of the thumbnails within the grid view

## Support

Got questions?

Feel free to [open an issue here][issue] on GitHub.
